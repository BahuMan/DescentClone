# DescentClone
Descent clone with the well-known 6DoF controls

use mouse for aiming, WSAD for moving in the horizontal plane and left-shift/left-ctrl for moving up/down
I'm currently experimenting with how much drag ("inertia dampers") to add. The aiming needed lots of damping. The movement might require less damping for fun strafing
